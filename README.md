# HeadFirstCode
Working on a Flask app using HeadFirstPython

* Note that you must have all of these files located in the same location on your local machine for the code to work. 
* I recommend launching the code from a command terminal. 
* Debug mode is initiated from the lower part of the code to allow you to play with the code without having to restart the app everytime you make changes.
